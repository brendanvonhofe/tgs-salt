# tgs-salt Kaggle competition

Install fastai from https://github.com/fastai/fastai

Initial up-scaling of images for UNet and downscaling for submission currently requires skimage which breaks the fastai
environment. Not the best solution but I have a separate environment to use skimage.

todo ~

	- Set up SSH access to local machine
	
	- Rewrite ipynb notebook as a more organized Python package.
	
	- Reflection padding and other ways to deal with image size
	
	- cross fold validation
	
	- early stopping
	
	- Combat overfitting
	
		- Dropout
		
		- Additional data augmentation
		
			- Shearing, zooming, distortions, etc.
			
	- Define hyperparameters and write scripts to tune em
	
		- Dilated conv
		
		- Train model from scratch?
		
	- Implement additional models (see below)
	
	- Ensemble
	
	- *** Architecture search
